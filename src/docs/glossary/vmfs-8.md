## Configuration Examples

### ESXi CLI Configuration
```bash
# Check VMFS version and details
esxcli storage vmfs extent list | grep -i vmfs8

# Create VMFS 8 datastore
esxcli storage filesystem vmfs create -d <device_name> -M <datastore_name> -S VMFS8

# Upgrade existing VMFS to VMFS 8
esxcli storage vmfs upgrade -v <volume_label> -V 8

# View VMFS filesystem information
esxcli storage filesystem list | grep -i vmfs8
```

### PowerCLI Configuration
```powershell
# Create VMFS 8 datastore
New-Datastore -VMHost "esxi01.domain.com" -Name "VMFS8-Datastore" -Path "<device_path>" -Vmfs -BlockSizeMB 4

# View VMFS datastore information
Get-Datastore | Where-Object {$_.Type -eq "VMFS"} | Select-Object Name, CapacityGB, FreeSpaceGB, FileSystemVersion

# Upgrade VMFS datastore
Get-Datastore "OldVMFS" | Set-Datastore -UpgradeVmfs
```

### vSphere Client Configuration
```xml
<!-- VMFS configuration parameters -->
vmfs.version = "8"
vmfs.blocksize = "4MB"
vmfs.maxfilesize = "62TB"
vmfs.maxvolumesize = "128TB"
```
