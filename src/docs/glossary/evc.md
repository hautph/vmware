Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) is a feature in VMware vSphere that ensures CPU compatibility between different generations of processors within a cluster, enabling seamless vMotion operations. EVC masks advanced CPU features to present a consistent CPU feature set to virtual machines, allowing them to migrate between hosts with different CPU generations.

## Overview

Enhanced vMotion Compatibility provides:
- CPU compatibility across different processor generations
- Seamless vMotion between heterogeneous hosts
- Masking of advanced CPU features
- Support for hardware upgrades without VM downtime

## Key Features

### CPU Compatibility
- **Feature Masking**: Hiding advanced CPU features from VMs
- **Consistent Interface**: Presenting uniform CPU feature set to VMs
- **Cross-Generation Support**: Enabling vMotion between different CPU generations
- **Vendor Support**: Support for both Intel and AMD processors

### Migration Benefits
- **Seamless vMotion**: Migration without CPU compatibility issues
- **Hardware Flexibility**: Easy hardware upgrades and replacements
- **Cluster Expansion**: Adding new hosts with different CPU generations
- **Maintenance Operations**: Simplified maintenance and patching

### Management Capabilities
- **EVC Modes**: Different EVC modes for various CPU generations
- **Cluster Configuration**: Easy EVC configuration at cluster level
- **Monitoring**: Visibility into EVC status and compatibility
- **Upgrade Support**: Support for EVC mode upgrades

## Architecture

### EVC Components

## Best Practices

1. **Mode Selection**: Choose appropriate EVC mode for environment
2. **Planning**: Plan EVC configuration during cluster design
3. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor EVC status and compatibility
4. **Testing**: Test EVC configuration in non-production environments
5. **Documentation**: Document EVC configuration and requirements
6. **Upgrade Planning**: Plan for EVC mode upgrades when needed

## Troubleshooting Commands

```powershell
# Check EVC status for cluster
Get-Cluster "ClusterName" | Select Name, EVCMode, EVCSupported

# Enable EVC for cluster
Set-Cluster -Cluster "ClusterName" -EVCMode "Intel-IvyBridge"

# View host EVC compatibility
Get-VMHost | Select Name, ProcessorType, EVCSupported

# Check EVC recommendations
Get-EVCRecommendation -Cluster "ClusterName"

# Disable EVC for cluster
Set-Cluster -Cluster "ClusterName" -EVCMode $null
```
