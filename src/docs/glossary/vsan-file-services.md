vSAN File Services provides native file shares (NFS and SMB) directly from a vSAN cluster. This allows vSAN to serve as a unified storage platform for both block and file storage, simplifying infrastructure and management for virtualized environments.

## Key Features

*   **Native File Shares:** Supports NFS v3/v4.1 and SMB v2.1/v3.0 protocols, enabling access to file shares from various clients.
*   **Integrated with vSAN:** Leverages the underlying vSAN storage for data resilience, performance, and scalability.
*   **Simplified Management:** File shares are managed directly from vCenter Server, providing a single control plane for both block and file storage.
*   **Policy-Based Management:** Allows administrators to apply storage policies to file shares, ensuring desired levels of performance and availability.
