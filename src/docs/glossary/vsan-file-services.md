vSAN File Services provides native file shares (NFS and SMB) directly from a vSAN cluster. This allows vSAN to serve as a unified storage platform for both block and file storage, simplifying infrastructure and management for virtualized environments. vSAN File Services extends the capabilities of vSAN beyond traditional block storage to include enterprise-grade file services, enabling organizations to consolidate their storage infrastructure while maintaining high performance and availability.
