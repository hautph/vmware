The vSAN iSCSI Target Service allows applications and physical servers that are external to the vSAN cluster to access storage provided by vSAN. This service presents vSAN storage as iSCSI targets, enabling a broader range of workloads to leverage the benefits of vSAN.

## Key Features

*   **External Storage Access:** Provides block storage access to non-vSphere workloads, physical servers, or other virtualization platforms.
*   **Integrated with vSAN:** Leverages the underlying vSAN storage for data resilience, performance, and scalability.
*   **Simplified Management:** iSCSI targets are managed directly from vCenter Server, providing a unified management experience.
*   **Policy-Based Management:** Allows administrators to apply storage policies to iSCSI LUNs, ensuring desired levels of performance and availability.
