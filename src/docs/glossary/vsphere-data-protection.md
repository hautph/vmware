vSphere Data Protection (VDP) was a disk-based backup and recovery solution for vSphere environments, powered by EMC Avamar. It provided agentless, image-level backups of virtual machines and offered features like deduplication, replication, and granular recovery options. While VDP has reached end-of-life, the concept of data protection remains critical in vSphere environments, often fulfilled by third-party backup solutions.

## Key Features (Historical)

*   **Agentless Backups:** Performed image-level backups of virtual machines without requiring agents inside the guest OS.
*   **Variable-Length Deduplication:** Significantly reduced storage consumption by eliminating redundant data.
*   **Integrated with vCenter Server:** Managed directly from the vSphere Client, simplifying backup administration.
*   **Granular Recovery:** Allowed for recovery of entire virtual machines, individual disks, or even specific files.
*   **Replication:** Supported replication of backup data to a secondary VDP appliance for disaster recovery.

## Modern Alternatives

Today, many third-party backup and recovery solutions integrate with vSphere APIs for Data Protection (VADP) to provide comprehensive data protection capabilities, offering advanced features and broader compatibility.
