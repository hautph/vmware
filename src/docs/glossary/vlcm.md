vSphere Lifecycle Manager (vLCM) is a unified and simplified solution for vSphere lifecycle management. It provides a centralized and automated way to create, manage, and update ESXi hosts and clusters.

## vSphere 8 Enhancements

In vSphere 8, vLCM has received several enhancements:

*   **Live Patch:** Enables the resolution of critical bugs in the virtual machine execution environment (vmx) without requiring a host reboot or evacuation.
*   **Advanced Image Customization:** Provides more granular control over ESXi image customization.
*   **Support for Dual DPU Configurations:** Integrates with the new dual DPU support for comprehensive lifecycle management.
*   **Staging Support (for ESXi hosts):** Allows ESXi hosts to be staged without entering maintenance mode, reducing the impact of lifecycle operations.
*   **Parallel Remediation:** Facilitates the remediation of multiple hosts concurrently, significantly cutting down the time required to remediate an entire ESXi Cluster.
