vSAN Express Storage Architecture (ESA) is a new, optional architecture introduced in vSphere 8 for VMware vSAN. It is designed to unlock the full potential of modern hardware, such as NVMe-based TLC storage devices, offering enhanced performance, efficiency, and data services.

## Key Features and Benefits

*   **Optimized for Modern Hardware:** ESA is built from the ground up to take advantage of high-performance storage devices, providing significant improvements in throughput and latency.
*   **Single-Tier Architecture:** Simplifies storage management by eliminating the traditional cache and capacity tiers, allowing all devices to contribute to both performance and capacity.
*   **Enhanced Data Services:** Offers improved data compression and deduplication, leading to greater storage efficiency.
*   **Increased Scalability:** Designed to scale more efficiently with modern hardware, supporting larger and more demanding workloads.
