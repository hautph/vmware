EtherChannel is Cisco's proprietary technology for link aggregation that bundles multiple physical Ethernet links into a single logical link. While LACP is the standardized protocol for link aggregation, EtherChannel is the Cisco implementation that predates LACP and is still widely used in Cisco networking environments.

## Overview

EtherChannel provides:
- Increased bandwidth by combining multiple physical links
- Redundancy through automatic failover
- Simplified network management with a single logical interface
- Load balancing across member links

## EtherChannel vs LACP

| Feature | EtherChannel | LACP |
|---------|--------------|------|
| Standardization | Cisco Proprietary | IEEE Standard (802.3ad) |
| Configuration | Manual or PAgP | Automatic negotiation |
| Interoperability | Cisco devices only | Multi-vendor support |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | More flexible |

## Configuration Example

Configuring EtherChannel on Cisco switches:

```bash
# Configure EtherChannel using PAgP (Cisco's proprietary protocol)
interface range gigabitEthernet 0/1 - 2
channel-group 1 mode desirable
exit

interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

On the VMware side with vSphere Distributed Switch:

```powershell
# Configure static EtherChannel (no LACP)
$lacpPolicy = New-Object VMware.Vim.VMwareUplinkLacpPolicy
$lacpPolicy.enable = $false

Get-VDUplinkPortgroup "UplinkPG" | Set-VDUplinkPortgroup -LacpPolicy $lacpPolicy

# Configure load balancing for static link aggregation
Get-VDSwitch "VDS-Production" | Get-VDUplinkPortgroup | Set-VDUplinkPortgroup -LoadBalancingAlgorithm "LoadBalanceIP"
```

## EtherChannel Modes

### Desirable Mode
- Actively attempts to negotiate EtherChannel
- Initiates PAgP negotiation

### Auto Mode
- Passively waits for EtherChannel negotiation
- Responds to PAgP packets but doesn't initiate

### On Mode
- Forces EtherChannel without negotiation
- Requires manual configuration on both ends

## Best Practices

1. Match EtherChannel modes on both ends of the connection
2. Ensure consistent VLAN configurations across all member links
3. Use the same speed and duplex settings on all member interfaces
4. Monitor link utilization to ensure proper load balancing
5. Document EtherChannel configurations for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check EtherChannel status on Cisco switch
show etherchannel summary
show etherchannel port-channel

# Verify link status
show interfaces etherchannel 1

# On ESXi host, check uplink status
esxcli network vswitch dvs vmware uplink list
```
