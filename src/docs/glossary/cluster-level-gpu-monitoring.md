Cluster Level GPU Monitoring, introduced in vSphere 8, provides a consolidated view of GPU compute and memory consumption within the vSphere Client. This feature offers both historical and real-time utilization data for GPUs across an entire cluster.

## Benefits

*   **Centralized Visibility:** Administrators can easily monitor GPU usage across all hosts and virtual machines in a cluster from a single interface.
*   **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Detailed insights into GPU performance help in making informed decisions for allocating GPU resources to AI/ML and other graphics-intensive workloads.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Simplifies the identification of performance bottlenecks or underutilized GPU resources.
