## Configuration and Management

### Private Cloud Management
```bash
# Register VCF fleet with private cloud via API
curl -X POST "https://vcf-private-cloud-manager/api/v1/private-cloud/fleets" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d @fleet-registration.json

# View private cloud status
curl -X GET "https://vcf-private-cloud-manager/api/v1/private-cloud/status" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Apply policy to private cloud
curl -X POST "https://vcf-private-cloud-manager/api/v1/private-cloud/policies" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d @private-cloud-policy.json

# Check private cloud health
curl -X GET "https://vcf-private-cloud-manager/api/v1/private-cloud/health" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
