Memory Compression is a memory reclamation technique in VMware ESXi that compresses memory pages to reduce their footprint when the host is experiencing memory pressure. This technique provides a middle ground between the efficiency of ballooning and the performance impact of swapping, offering better performance than swapping while still reclaiming memory resources.

## Overview

Memory Compression provides:
- Memory reclamation through page compression
- Better performance than disk swapping
- Automatic operation when memory pressure occurs
- Transparent operation to guest operating systems

## Key Features

### Compression Benefits
- **Memory Savings**: Reduction in memory footprint through compression
- **Performance**: Better performance than disk swapping
- **Automatic Operation**: Transparent operation without manual intervention
- **Reversibility**: Decompression when memory pressure is relieved

### Compression Process
- **Page Selection**: Selection of appropriate pages for compression
- **Compression Algorithm**: Efficient compression of memory pages
- **Memory Buffer**: Storage of compressed pages in memory buffer
- **Decompression**: Decompression when pages are accessed

### Performance Characteristics
- **Lower Latency**: Reduced latency compared to disk swapping
- **CPU Overhead**: Minimal CPU overhead for compression operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Efficient use of memory for compressed pages
- **Quality of Service**: Maintained performance for critical workloads

## Architecture

### Compression Components
- **Compression Service**: Component that handles page compression
- **Memory Buffer**: Dedicated memory area for compressed pages
- **Compression Cache**: Cache for frequently accessed compressed pages
- **Decompression Engine**: Engine for decompressing pages on access

### Memory Management Integration
- **Memory Scheduler**: Integration with ESXi memory scheduler
- **Resource Pools**: Integration with memory resource pools
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of compression effectiveness
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Algorithms that adapt to workload characteristics

### Compression Workflow
1. **Memory Pressure Detection**: Host detects memory pressure
2. **Page Selection**: Selection of pages suitable for compression
3. **Compression**: Compression of selected pages
4. **Buffer Storage**: Storage of compressed pages in memory buffer
5. **Access Handling**: Decompression when compressed pages are accessed
6. **Pressure Relief**: Decompression when memory pressure is relieved

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# View memory compression statistics
esxtop (press 'm' for memory view, then check compression columns)

# Check compression settings
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Mem/ZipEnable
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Mem/ZipMaxAllocated

# View memory reclamation information
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Mem/

# Check VM memory configuration
vim-cmd vmsvc/get.config <vmid> | grep -i memory

# View detailed memory statistics
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Mem/Zip*
```
