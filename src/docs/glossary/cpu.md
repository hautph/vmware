The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer system that executes instructions and performs calculations for all software applications and operating systems. In virtualized environments, CPUs are shared among multiple virtual machines through hypervisor scheduling and resource allocation mechanisms.

## Overview

CPU provides:
- Instruction execution and processing
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Control flow management
- Data movement between memory and storage
- Virtualization support for multiple workloads

## Key Features

### Processing Capabilities
- **Instruction Set Architecture**: Support for complex instruction sets (x86, ARM)
- **Clock Speed**: Processing frequency measured in GHz
- **Cores and Threads**: Multiple processing units for parallel execution
- **Cache Memory**: High-speed memory for frequently accessed data

### Virtualization Support
- **Hardware-assisted Virtualization**: Intel VT-x and AMD-V support
- **Multiple VM Support**: Concurrent execution of virtual machines
- **Resource Scheduling**: Hypervisor-based CPU allocation
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques like CPU affinity and reservation

### Performance Metrics
- **Clock Rate**: Processing speed in gigahertz (GHz)
- **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)**: Efficiency of instruction execution
- **Thermal Design Power (TDP)**: Power consumption and heat generation
- **Benchmarks**: Performance measurements for specific workloads

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Control Unit**: Manages instruction execution and data flow
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations
- **Registers**: High-speed storage for active data and instructions
- **Cache Hierarchy**: L1, L2, and L3 cache for performance optimization

### Multi-core Design
- **Physical Cores**: Independent processing units on a single chip
- **Logical Cores**: Hyperthreading for simultaneous multithreading
- **Core Isolation**: Separation of workloads for security and performance
- **Inter-core Communication**: Efficient data sharing between cores

### Instruction Processing
- **Fetch**: Retrieval of instructions from memory
- **Decode**: Interpretation of instruction requirements
- **Execute**: Performance of required operations
- **Write-back**: Storage of results to memory or registers

## Virtualization in VMware

### CPU Virtualization
- **VMkernel Scheduler**: ESXi's CPU scheduling mechanism
- **CPU Affinity**: Binding VMs to specific physical cores
- **CPU Reservation**: Guaranteed minimum CPU allocation
- **CPU Limits**: Maximum CPU usage restrictions

### Resource Management
- **CPU Shares**: Priority-based resource allocation
- **CPU Ready Time**: Time VMs wait for CPU resources
- **CPU Overcommitment**: Running more vCPUs than physical cores
- **NUMA Topology**: Non-Uniform Memory Access optimization

### Performance Monitoring
- **ESXTOP**: Real-time CPU performance analysis
- **vCenter Performance Charts**: Historical CPU usage data
- **CPU Utilization Metrics**: Percentage of CPU usage over time
- **Ready Queue Analysis**: VM waiting times for CPU resources

## Configuration Examples

### ESXi CPU Configuration
```bash
# View CPU information
esxcli hardware cpu list

# Check CPU scheduler settings
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Scheduler/

# View NUMA topology

# Check CPU power management
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Power/CpuPolicy
```

### PowerCLI CPU Management
```powershell
# View CPU information for ESXi hosts
Get-VMHost | Select Name, CpuTotalMhz, CpuUsedMHz

# Set CPU reservation for a VM
Get-VM "MyVM" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name "sched.cpu.min" -Value 1000 -Confirm:$false

# Configure CPU limit for a VM
Get-VM "MyVM" | New-AdvancedSetting -Name "sched.cpu.max" -Value 2000 -Confirm:$false

# Set CPU shares for a VM
Get-VM "MyVM" | Get-View | Select-Object Name, @{N="CpuShares";E={$_.Config.CpuAllocation.Shares.Shares}}
```
