Live Patch is a feature introduced in vSphere 8 that enables the resolution of critical bugs in the virtual machine execution environment (vmx) without requiring a host reboot or virtual machine evacuation. This is achieved using non-disruptive fast-suspend-resume (FSR) operations for VMs.

## Benefits

*   **Reduced Downtime:** Critical issues can be addressed without impacting running virtual machines, minimizing service interruptions.
*   **Improved Availability:** Enhances the overall availability of the vSphere environment by allowing patches to be applied without planned downtime.
*   **Simplified Operations:** Streamlines the patching process for ESXi hosts, making it easier to maintain a secure and stable environment.
