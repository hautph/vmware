vSphere Trust Authority is VMware's native security solution that provides cryptographic protection for virtual machines, enabling encryption of VMs at rest and in transit with hardware-backed key management. Trust Authority establishes a hardened trust foundation for critical workloads, ensuring data protection and compliance with security standards.

## Overview

vSphere Trust Authority provides:
- Hardware-backed key management
- VM encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure boot and attestation
- Compliance with security standards
- Integration with external key management systems

## Key Features

### Cryptographic Protection
- **VM Encryption**: Full disk encryption for virtual machines
- **Key Management**: Hardware security module (HSM) backed key management
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation and management
- **Key Recovery**: Secure key recovery mechanisms

### Attestation Services
- **Hardware Attestation**: Verification of hardware integrity
- **Boot Attestation**: Secure boot process validation
- **Runtime Attestation**: Continuous verification of system integrity

5. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant security standards

## Troubleshooting Commands

```powershell
# Check Trust Authority cluster status
Get-TrustAuthorityCluster | Select Name, State, Status

# View key providers
Get-KeyProvider

# Check VM encryption status
Get-VM "EncryptedVM" | Select Name, ExtensionData.Config.Flags
```

```bash
# Check ESXi host attestation status
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /UserVars/TPMAttestation

# View encryption status
vim-cmd vimsvc/task_list | grep -i encryption

# Check trust authority logs
tail -f /var/log/vmware/trustauthority/*.log
```
