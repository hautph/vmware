A Virtual Switch is a software-based network switch that operates within the VMware ESXi hypervisor to connect virtual machines to each other and to external physical networks. Virtual switches provide the networking infrastructure for VMs to communicate with each other, with physical networks, and with host management services. They function similarly to physical network switches but operate entirely in software, providing advanced features and capabilities specifically designed for virtualized environments.

## Overview

Virtual Switches provide:
- Network connectivity for virtual machines
- Bridging between virtual and physical networks
- Advanced switching and routing capabilities
- Network policy enforcement and security
- Traffic monitoring and management

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Port Groups**: Logical network segments with policies
- **Uplinks**: Connections to physical network adapters
- **VMkernel Ports**: Host service network interfaces
- **Virtual Machine Ports**: VM network interfaces
- **Forwarding Engine**: Packet forwarding and processing

### Switching Logic
- **Layer 2 Switching**: MAC address-based forwarding
- **VLAN Tagging**: IEEE 802.1Q VLAN support
- **Broadcast Domains**: Logical broadcast separation
- **Unicast/Multicast**: Efficient traffic handling

## Types of Virtual Switches

### Standard Switch (VSS)
- **Host-Level**: Configured per ESXi host
- **Local Management**: Managed on individual hosts
- **Basic Features**: Standard switching capabilities

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# List virtual switches
esxcli network vswitch standard list

# Check switch details
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup list

# View port group information
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy failover get -p <portgroup-name>

# Check uplink status
esxcli network vswitch standard uplink list

# View switch logs
tail -f /var/log/vmkernel.log | grep net
```
