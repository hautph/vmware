5. **Backup and Recovery**: Maintain backup of critical configurations

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check vCenter Server status
service-control --status vmware-vpxd

# View client logs
tail -f /var/log/vmware/vpxd/vpxd.log

# Check network connectivity to vCenter
ping vcenter.example.com

# Verify certificate status
openssl x509 -in /etc/vmware-vpx/ssl/rui.crt -text -noout
```
