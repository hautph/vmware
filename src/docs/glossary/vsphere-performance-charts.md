*   **Real-time and Historical Data:** Displays both current performance data and historical trends, allowing for analysis over time.
*   **Customizable Charts:** Administrators can customize charts to display specific metrics, time ranges, and aggregation levels.
*   **Granular Metrics:** Provides a wide range of performance metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Helps in identifying performance bottlenecks, resource contention, and other performance-related issues.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Provides data for capacity planning and resource optimization.

## Access

Performance charts are accessible through the vSphere Client, offering a visual way to monitor the health and performance of the vSphere infrastructure.
