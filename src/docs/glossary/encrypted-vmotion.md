Encrypted vMotion is a security feature that encrypts the entire vMotion data stream during the live migration of virtual machines. This ensures that sensitive virtual machine data is protected from eavesdropping and tampering while it is being transferred between ESXi hosts, even across untrusted networks.

## Overview

Encrypted vMotion provides:
- End-to-end encryption for vMotion traffic
- Protection against data interception
- Integrity verification for migrated data
- Compliance with security regulations
- Seamless integration with existing vMotion workflows

## How It Works

### Encryption Process
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographic keys are generated for each vMotion session
- **Data Encryption**: Virtual machine memory and storage data are encrypted
- **Secure Transmission**: Encrypted data is transmitted over the network
- **Data Decryption**: Data is decrypted on the destination host

### Key Management
- **Key Exchange**: Secure key exchange between source and destination hosts
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation for enhanced security
- **Key Storage**: Secure storage of encryption keys
- **Key Destruction**: Secure destruction of keys after migration

## Architecture

### Components
- **Encryption Engine**: Handles encryption and decryption operations
- **Key Management Service**: Manages cryptographic keys
- **Certificate Authority**: Provides certificate management
- **Network Interface**: Handles encrypted network communication

### Workflow
1. **Initialization**: vMotion request is initiated
2. **Key Exchange**: Cryptographic keys are exchanged securely
3. **Encryption**: VM data is encrypted before transmission
4. **Transmission**: Encrypted data is sent over the network
5. **Decryption**: Data is decrypted on the destination host
6. **Verification**: Data integrity is verified
7. **Completion**: vMotion process is completed

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check vMotion encryption status
esxcli vmotion encryption get

# View encryption configuration
esxcli system settings encryption get

# Check certificate status
openssl x509 -in /etc/vmware/ssl/rui.crt -text -noout

# View vMotion logs
tail -f /var/log/vmotion.log

# Check network connectivity
vmkping -I vmk0 <destination-ip>
```
