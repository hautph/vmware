Memory Overcommitment is a virtualization feature that allows administrators to allocate more virtual memory to virtual machines than the total amount of physical RAM available on a host. This technique enables higher VM density and better resource utilization, but requires careful management to avoid performance degradation and memory contention.

## Overview

Memory Overcommitment provides:
- Higher virtual machine density on physical hosts
- Better utilization of physical memory resources
- Cost savings through reduced hardware requirements
- Flexible resource allocation for varying workloads

## Key Features

### Overcommitment Techniques
- **Memory Ballooning**: Reclamation of memory through guest OS cooperation
- **Memory Compression**: Compression of memory pages to reduce footprint
- **Memory Swapping**: Moving memory pages to disk storage
- **Transparent Page Sharing**: Sharing of identical memory pages between VMs

### Resource Management
- **Memory Reservation**: Guaranteed minimum memory allocation
- **Memory Limit**: Maximum memory that can be consumed
- **Memory Shares**: Priority-based memory allocation during contention
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Flexible memory allocation based on demand

### Monitoring and Control
- **Memory Utilization**: Real-time monitoring of memory usage
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed memory performance statistics
- **Resource Pools**: Grouping and managing memory resources
- **Quality of Service**: Ensuring consistent memory performance

## Architecture

### Memory Reclamation Techniques
- **Ballooning**: Guest OS driver that reclaims memory when host is under pressure
- **Compression**: Real-time compression of memory pages in memory buffer
- **Swapping**: Moving least recently used pages to disk-based swap files
- **Page Sharing**: Sharing of identical memory pages (largely disabled for security)

### Memory Management Components
- **VMkernel Memory Manager**: ESXi's memory management subsystem
- **Memory Scheduler**: Component that allocates memory to VMs
- **Resource Pools**: Logical groupings for memory resource management
- **Monitoring Tools**: Tools for tracking memory usage and performance

### Memory States
- **Active Memory**: Memory currently being used by VMs
- **Balloonable Memory**: Memory that can be reclaimed through ballooning
- **Swappable Memory**: Memory that can be moved to swap files
- **Shared Memory**: Memory that can be shared between VMs

## Best Practices

1. **Conservative Overcommitment**: Avoid excessive memory overcommitment ratios
2. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor memory utilization and performance metrics
3. **Resource Settings**: Properly configure memory reservations, limits, and shares
4. **Workload Analysis**: Understand memory requirements of different workloads
5. **Capacity Planning**: Plan memory capacity based on peak usage patterns
6. **Performance Testing**: Test memory configurations under load

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check memory information on ESXi host
esxcli hardware memory get

# View memory utilization
esxtop (press 'm' for memory view)

# Check VM memory configuration
vim-cmd vmsvc/get.config <vmid> | grep -A 10 "memory"

# View memory reclamation statistics
esxtop (press 'm' for memory view, then check balloon and swap columns)

# Check memory scheduler information
esxcli system settings advanced list -o /Mem/
```
