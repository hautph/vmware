# VMware Backup and Recovery Strategies

## Backup Methods

There are several approaches to backing up VMware environments:

### Image-Level Backup
Full VM snapshots and backups using third-party tools like Veeam or Commvault.

### File-Level Backup
Backing up individual files within guest operating systems.

### Application-Aware Backup
Backup solutions that integrate with applications like Exchange, SQL Server, etc.

## Recovery Considerations

When planning for recovery:

- Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- Test restore procedures regularly
- Maintain offsite backups for disaster recovery

```powershell
# PowerCLI script to restore a VM from snapshot
Get-VM "MyVM" | Get-Snapshot | Where {$_.Name -eq "BackupSnapshot"} | Set-VM -Snapshot -Confirm:$false
```

## Best Practices

1. Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite)
2. Schedule backups during low-usage periods
3. Monitor backup job success rates
4. Regularly test restore procedures
