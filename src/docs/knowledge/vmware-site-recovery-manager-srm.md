# VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) - Comprehensive Guide

VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) is an enterprise-grade disaster recovery automation solution that orchestrates the automated failover and failback of virtual machines and associated applications between primary and recovery sites. This comprehensive guide covers SRM architecture, implementation strategies, best practices, and advanced configuration options.

## Introduction to Site Recovery Manager

Site Recovery Manager addresses the critical need for organizations to maintain business continuity in the face of disasters, hardware failures, or planned maintenance events. It transforms complex, manual disaster recovery processes into automated, repeatable procedures that can be tested and validated without impacting production environments.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Recovery Orchestration**: Eliminates manual intervention in disaster recovery processes
- **Non-Disruptive Testing**: Enables regular testing of recovery plans without affecting production workloads
- **Compliance Assurance**: Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements for disaster recovery
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces the risk of extended downtime during disaster scenarios

## SRM Architecture and Components

### Core Components

1. **Site Recovery Manager Server**: Primary management component installed at both sites
2. **Recovery Plans**: XML-based definitions of recovery procedures and dependencies
3. **Placeholder VMs**: Lightweight representations of protected VMs at the recovery site
4. **Mapping Objects**: Defines relationships between protected and recovery site resources

### Site Configuration

- **Protected Site**: Primary data center running production workloads
- **Recovery Site**: Secondary data center for disaster recovery
- **vCenter Server Instances**: Separate instances managing each site
- **Network Configuration**: Defines network mappings between sites

### Replication Technologies

SRM supports multiple replication technologies:
- **vSphere Replication**: VMware's hypervisor-based replication solution
- **Array-Based Replication**: Storage vendor-specific replication technologies
- **Third-Party Integration**: Support for various storage array vendors

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before implementing SRM, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- vCenter Server 7.0 or later at both sites
- Compatible storage infrastructure
- Network connectivity between sites
- Sufficient resources at recovery site
- Proper DNS and time synchronization

### Installation Steps

1. **Install SRM Server**
   - Download SRM installer from VMware Customer Connect
   - Install SRM Server at both protected and recovery sites
   - Configure database connectivity
   - Establish site pairing between protected and recovery sites

2. **Configure Replication**
   - Choose replication method (vSphere Replication or array-based)
   - Configure replication settings for VMs
   - Set RPO values based on business requirements
   - Monitor initial synchronization progress

3. **Create Protection Groups**
   - Group related VMs into protection groups
   - Define replication policies for each group
   - Configure test networks
   - Validate protection group configuration

4. **Design Recovery Plans**
   - Create recovery plans for application groups
   - Define VM boot order and dependencies
   - Configure network mappings
   - Add custom scripts for application-specific tasks

### Configuration Examples

#### PowerShell/PowerCLI Configuration
```powershell
# Connect to vCenter Server
Connect-VIServer -Server "vcenter-primary.local"

# Create a new recovery plan
New-SRMRecoveryPlan -Name "Production-DR-Plan" -Description "Main production recovery plan"

# Add VMs to protection group
Get-SRMProtectionGroup -Name "Production-PG" | Add-SRMProtectedVM -VM (Get-VM -Name "WebServer01", "AppServer01", "DBServer01")

# Test recovery plan
Start-SRMRecoveryPlan -RecoveryPlan (Get-SRMRecoveryPlan -Name "Production-DR-Plan") -ValidateOnly

# Execute failover
Start-SRMRecoveryPlan -RecoveryPlan (Get-SRMRecoveryPlan -Name "Production-DR-Plan")
```

#### ESXi CLI Configuration
```bash
# Check SRM service status
service-control --status vmware-srm

# View protection group status
/usr/lib/vmware-srm/bin/srmctl protection-group list

# Monitor recovery plan execution
tail -f /var/log/vmware/srm/*.log
```

## Best Practices

### Recovery Objectives
- Define appropriate RTO and RPO values for different applications
- Align recovery objectives with business criticality
- Regularly review and update objectives based on changing requirements

### Regular Testing
- Test recovery plans regularly to ensure they work as expected
- Schedule tests during maintenance windows
- Document test results and any issues encountered
- Include business stakeholders in testing validation

### Network Planning
- Plan network configurations carefully to ensure proper failover
- Configure test networks for non-disruptive testing
- Document IP address mappings between sites
- Plan for DNS and Active Directory considerations

### Resource Sizing
- Ensure adequate resources at recovery site for failover scenarios
- Consider peak load requirements during failover
- Plan for storage capacity at recovery site
- Account for additional resources needed during testing

### Documentation
- Maintain detailed documentation of recovery procedures and dependencies
- Keep documentation updated with configuration changes
- Include contact information for key personnel
- Document escalation procedures

### Training
- Train staff on recovery procedures and tools
- Conduct regular training sessions for new team members
- Provide hands-on practice with SRM interface
- Include business users in DR procedures

- **SDDC Integration**: Seamless integration with Software-Defined Data Centers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Replication Failures**
   - Check network connectivity between sites
   - Verify storage array configuration
   - Review replication logs for specific errors
   - Ensure sufficient bandwidth for replication traffic

2. **Recovery Plan Execution Failures**
   - Validate VM configurations at recovery site
   - Check network mappings and connectivity
   - Review custom script execution logs
   - Verify resource availability at recovery site
