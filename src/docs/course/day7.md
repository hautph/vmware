- **CPU Co-stop**: Time spent waiting for co-scheduled vCPUs
- **CPU Latency**: Delay in processing CPU requests

**Memory Performance Metrics:**
- **Memory Usage**: Percentage of memory utilization
- **Memory Ballooning**: Amount of memory reclaimed by balloon driver
- **Memory Swapping**: Amount of memory swapped to disk
- **Memory Compression**: Amount of memory compressed

**Storage Performance Metrics:**
- **Disk IOPS**: Input/output operations per second
- **Disk Latency**: Time to complete disk operations
- **Disk Throughput**: Data transfer rate
- **Disk Queue Depth**: Number of pending disk operations

**Network Performance Metrics:**
- **Network Usage**: Bandwidth utilization

### 2. Alarm Configuration and Management

#### Understanding Alarms
Alarms provide automated monitoring and alerting for specific conditions in the vSphere environment.

**Alarm Components:**
- **Triggers**: Conditions that activate alarms
- **Actions**: Responses to alarm triggers
- **Status**: Current state of alarms (OK, Warning, Alert)
- **Reporting**: Notification and logging mechanisms

#### Creating Custom Alarms

**Steps to Create Alarms:**
1. In vSphere Client, navigate to **Monitor** > **Alarm Definitions**
2. Click **Create** to start new alarm wizard
3. Define alarm name, description, and target type
4. Configure triggers and conditions
5. Set alarm actions and notifications
6. Review and complete alarm creation

**Common Alarm Types:**
- **Host Alarms**: CPU, memory, storage, and network thresholds
- **Virtual Machine Alarms**: Performance, availability, and configuration issues
- **Datastore Alarms**: Space utilization and connectivity problems
- **Cluster Alarms**: Resource utilization and health status

#### Alarm Actions
- **Email Notifications**: Send alerts to administrators
- **SNMP Traps**: Integrate with monitoring systems
- **Run Scripts**: Execute automated response actions
- **vCenter Server Logging**: Record alarm events

#### Best Practices
- Define appropriate thresholds based on workload requirements
- Use hierarchical alarm inheritance for consistent monitoring
- Regularly review and update alarm configurations
- Test alarm notifications and actions
- Document alarm purposes and response procedures

### 3. Custom Performance Metrics and Views

#### Creating Custom Performance Charts
Custom performance charts allow you to focus on specific metrics and time periods relevant to your environment.

**Steps to Create Custom Charts:**
1. In vSphere Client, navigate to **Monitor** > **Performance**
2. Select the object to monitor
3. Click **Advanced** to access detailed metrics
4. Customize chart parameters and time ranges
5. Save custom views for future reference

#### Performance Data Collection
**Collection Levels:**
- **Level 1**: Basic metrics (default)
- **Level 2**: Additional metrics for CPU and memory
- **Level 3**: Detailed metrics for all resources
- **Level 4**: Maximum detail for troubleshooting

**Considerations:**
- Higher collection levels increase storage requirements
- Higher collection levels may impact performance
- Balance detail requirements with resource constraints
- Plan retention periods for performance data

#### Performance Analysis Techniques
- **Baseline Creation**: Establish normal performance patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify performance changes over time
- **Correlation Analysis**: Connect related performance issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Project future resource requirements
