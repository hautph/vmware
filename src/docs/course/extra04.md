## Workload Management

Managing workloads in vSphere with Kubernetes requires understanding both Kubernetes and vSphere concepts.

### Pod Deployment

Deploying pods in vSphere with Kubernetes follows standard Kubernetes practices:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.20
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

### Resource Management

Resource management combines Kubernetes and vSphere capabilities:

* **Resource Quotas**: Define limits at the namespace level
* **Limit Ranges**: Set default resource requests and limits for containers

* **vSphere Resource Pools**: Map Kubernetes resources to vSphere resource pools

### Storage Provisioning

Storage provisioning leverages vSphere storage capabilities:

* **Dynamic Provisioning**: Automatic creation of persistent volumes
