Workload Availability Zones, a feature within Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 2.0 in vSphere 8, facilitate the deployment of Kubernetes clusters across multiple vSphere clusters. This enhances the resilience and availability of cloud-native applications by distributing workloads across different failure domains.

## Benefits

*   **High Availability:** By spreading Kubernetes clusters across multiple vSphere clusters, applications can remain operational even if one vSphere cluster experiences an outage.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Provides a robust architecture for disaster recovery scenarios, allowing for quicker recovery of applications.
*   **Improved Resilience:** Increases the overall fault tolerance of cloud-native deployments within a vSphere environment.
