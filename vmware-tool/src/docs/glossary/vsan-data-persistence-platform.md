The vSAN Data Persistence Platform (DPp) is a framework within vSAN that allows third-party stateful service providers (e.g., object storage, databases) to integrate directly with vSAN. This enables these services to leverage vSAN's underlying storage capabilities while offering their own data persistence and management features.

## Key Features

*   **Native Integration:** Allows stateful services to run natively on vSAN, benefiting from its performance, scalability, and resilience.
*   **Simplified Deployment and Management:** Provides a streamlined way to deploy and manage stateful services within a vSAN environment.
*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Enables efficient use of vSAN storage resources by these services.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Offers APIs and tools for service providers to integrate their offerings with vSAN.
