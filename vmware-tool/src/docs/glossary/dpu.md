A Data Processing Unit (DPU) is a new class of programmable processor that works alongside CPUs and GPUs to handle computing operations, primarily related to networking. In vSphere 8, DPUs can offload CPU tasks, particularly for networking and communications, to enhance performance and free up CPU resources.

## vSphere 8 Integration

*   **Distributed Services Engine:** vSphere 8 leverages DPUs with the Distributed Services Engine to offload infrastructure functions from the server CPU to the DPU, improving performance and efficiency.
*   **Dual DPU Support:** vSphere 8 Update 3 introduced support for two DPUs per host, providing options for active/standby high availability or increased offload capacity.
*   **vSphere Distributed Switch version 8.0 with DPU:** This new virtual switch version utilizes DPUs to boost network performance, security encryption, isolation, and protection through network offloads.
