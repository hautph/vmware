vSphere Configuration Profiles provide a declarative way to manage the desired state of vSphere clusters. This feature allows administrators to define a desired configuration and then apply it consistently across multiple hosts and clusters.

## vSphere 8 Enhancements

In vSphere 8, vSphere Configuration Profiles extend support to baseline-managed clusters, offering a unified approach to configuration management across different cluster types.
