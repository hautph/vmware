# VMware Glossary Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve issues with the VMware Glossary page, specifically:
1. Lazy loading not working when scrolling
2. Search suggestions not displaying properly

## Issues Identified

### 1. Lazy Loading Not Working
The infinite scroll functionality was not triggering when users scrolled to the bottom of the page. This was caused by:
- Inaccurate scroll position detection
- Missing fallback mechanism for loading more content
- No visual feedback when more content was available

### 2. Search Suggestions Not Displaying
The search suggestions dropdown was not appearing when typing in the search box. This was caused by:
- Incorrect CSS class handling (using `d-none` instead of a `show` class)
- Improper event handling for showing/hiding suggestions
- Missing proper styling for the suggestions dropdown

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved Infinite Scroll
- Enhanced scroll position detection using multiple methods to ensure compatibility across browsers
- Added a fallback "Load More" button for manual loading when scroll detection fails
- Improved visual feedback with loading indicators
- Added debugging information to console for troubleshooting

### 2. Fixed Search Suggestions
- Replaced `d-none` class with a `show` class for better control of visibility
- Improved CSS styling for the suggestions dropdown
- Enhanced keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
