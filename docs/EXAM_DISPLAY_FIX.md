# Exam Display Fix

This document summarizes the fix made to the VMware Certification Practice Exams to properly display one question at a time instead of showing all questions at once.

## Issue Identified

The exam interface was displaying all questions at once instead of showing one question at a time as intended. This was due to a bug in the start exam functionality where the [examContent](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs#L39-L41) div (containing all questions) was not being hidden when the exam started.

## Fix Implemented

### Problem Location
In [src/views/exam/exam.ejs](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs), the `startExamBtn` click event handler had incorrect logic for showing/hiding elements.

### Solution
Changed the line:
```javascript
examContent.classList.remove('d-none');
```

To:
```javascript
examContent.classList.add('d-none');
```

This ensures that when the exam starts:
1. The [examIntroduction](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs#L36-L67) div is hidden (as it was already)
2. The [examContent](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs#L39-L41) div is hidden (this was the bug - it was being shown instead)
3. The [examInterface](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs#L43-L101) div is shown (as it was already)

### Result
Now when users start the exam:
1. They see the introduction screen first with exam rules and guidelines
2. When they click "Start Exam", only one question is displayed at a time
3. Users can navigate between questions using the Previous/Next buttons
4. The question summary grid allows jumping to any question
5. All other exam functionality works as intended

## Benefits

1. **Proper Exam Experience**: Users now see one question at a time as expected in a real exam
2. **Reduced Clutter**: The interface is cleaner and less overwhelming
3. **Better Focus**: Users can concentrate on one question at a time
4. **Professional Environment**: The exam now simulates a real certification exam environment
5. **Improved Usability**: Navigation is more intuitive with proper question-by-question display

## Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- Introduction screen displays correctly
- Clicking "Start Exam" properly hides all questions and shows only the first question
- Navigation between questions works correctly
- Question summary grid functions properly
- All other exam features work as expected
