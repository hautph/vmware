# Exam Submit Functionality Fix

This document summarizes the fix made to resolve the "Error Something went wrong!" issue when submitting exams.

## Issue Identified

When users clicked "Submit Exam", they encountered an "Error Something went wrong!" message. Investigation revealed that the issue was caused by incorrect route configurations that resulted in invalid URLs for exam submission.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Route Configuration Issue
In [src/routes/exam.js](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/routes/exam.js), the routes were incorrectly defined as:
```javascript
router.get('/exam/:id', getExam);
router.post('/exam/:id/submit', submitExam);
```

However, since the exam routes are mounted at `/exam` in [app.js](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/app.js) with:
```javascript
app.use('/exam', examRoutes);
```

This resulted in actual paths becoming:
- `/exam/exam/:id` (instead of `/exam/:id`)
- `/exam/exam/:id/submit` (instead of `/exam/:id/submit`)

### 2. Form Action URL Issue
In [src/views/exam/exam.ejs](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs), the JavaScript code was creating forms with incorrect action URLs:
```javascript
form.action = `/exam/exam/<%= exam.id %>/submit`;
```

This also resulted in invalid submission URLs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Route Definitions
Updated [src/routes/exam.js](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/routes/exam.js) to use correct paths:
```javascript
// Get specific exam
router.get('/:id', getExam);

// Submit exam results
router.post('/:id/submit', submitExam);
```

### 2. Fixed Form Action URLs
Updated the JavaScript code in [src/views/exam/exam.ejs](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/exam.ejs) to use correct URLs:
```javascript
form.action = `/exam/<%= exam.id %>/submit`;
```

This change was applied to both submission methods:
1. Submit via modal (submitExamBtn event listener)
2. Direct submit (submitBtn event listener)

## Result

After implementing these fixes:
1. Exam routes now work correctly with proper URL structure
2. Form submissions now use valid URLs
3. Users can successfully submit exams without encountering errors
4. The exam results page displays correctly with performance statistics

## Benefits

1. **Resolved Submission Error**: Users can now successfully submit exams
2. **Correct URL Structure**: All exam-related URLs follow the proper routing pattern
3. **Improved User Experience**: No more error messages when submitting exams
4. **Consistent with Application Architecture**: Routes now properly align with how Express.js routing works

## Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- Exam routes are accessible at correct URLs
- Form submissions use valid action URLs
- Exam submission process completes successfully
- Results page displays correctly with user answers and statistics
- No error messages appear during submission
