# Exam Link Fix

This document summarizes the fix made to resolve the "Page Not Found" error when starting exams.

## Issue Identified

When users navigated to `http://localhost:3000/exam` and clicked "Start Exam", they were redirected to `http://localhost:3000/exam/exam/vmware01` (with double "/exam") instead of the correct URL `http://localhost:3000/exam/vmware01`. This resulted in a "Page Not Found" error.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the exam index page template ([src/views/exam/index.ejs](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/index.ejs)) where the link to start an exam was incorrectly formatted:

```html
<a href="/exam/exam/<%= exam.id %>" class="btn btn-primary mt-auto">
```

Since the exam routes are mounted at `/exam` in [app.js](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/app.js) and the route for getting a specific exam is defined as `/:id` in [src/routes/exam.js](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/routes/exam.js), the correct URL should be `/exam/<%= exam.id %>`.

## Solution Implemented

Fixed the link in [src/views/exam/index.ejs](file:///Users/hautp/Documents/github/vmware/src/views/exam/index.ejs):

```html
<!-- Changed from: -->
<a href="/exam/exam/<%= exam.id %>" class="btn btn-primary mt-auto">

<!-- To: -->
<a href="/exam/<%= exam.id %>" class="btn btn-primary mt-auto">
```

## Result

After implementing this fix:
1. Users can now click "Start Exam" and be correctly redirected to the exam page
2. No more "Page Not Found" errors when starting exams
3. The URL structure is consistent with the application's routing architecture

## Benefits

1. **Resolved Navigation Error**: Users can now access exams without encountering 404 errors
2. **Correct URL Structure**: All exam-related URLs follow the proper routing pattern
3. **Improved User Experience**: Seamless navigation from exam list to exam page
4. **Consistent with Application Architecture**: Links now properly align with how Express.js routing works

## Testing

The fix has been tested to ensure:
- Exam links in the index page point to correct URLs
- Clicking "Start Exam" navigates to the proper exam page
- No "Page Not Found" errors occur when starting exams
- Exam functionality works correctly after navigation
